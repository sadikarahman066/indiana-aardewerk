Updated December 2025

This game was made within a Smart Solution Semester project for Archaeology faculty of Saxion University. The goal of the project is digitalising old-fashion prehistoric pottery lectures and giving students different means of receiving the knowledge, so that the students will be more interested in learning about prehistoric pottery.

The game was inspired by the Gold Miner game. The player will play as an intern at the archeological excavation site. This intern will learn about different aspects of archeology revolving around prehistoric pottery. There is the character "the boss" plays as the task giver of the game, but he is also the teacher to provide players some small pieces of information about prehistoric pottery.

The game is still open to be developed bigger. The game map can be extended for more interesting game mechanics which are suitable to transfer more knowledge about prehistoric pottery.
